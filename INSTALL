-===============================================-


If you have comments, problems, bugs or an idea send a mail to: indiana at rednova.de
Thanks for using my RPP.


 INSTALL
---------
This is for Admin's who just start a new BNT game.

1) Normaly install BNT v0.41

2) Copy all files from RPP v0.1 to BNT v0.41 (overwrite all files)

3a) Extend config_local.php with:
$bnt_ls_gameurl = "http://long.rednova.de/"; // Absolut URL to YOUR game !!!
$bnt_ls = true;                         // true = Add your game to the public list ; false = private game
$bnt_ls_key = "myKey";                  // enter an authentification key here (always use the same key for the same server/game)

$max_team_members = 6;                  // Max Members per Team (if limit reached, the INVITE Link is disabled.
$servertimezone = "CET [GMT+1]";        // Your Timezone as a string which will just display in footer
$GameDuration = 86400 * 90;             // Time(in seconds) until the game should automaticly closed and Hall of Fame generated. -1 means no automation HOF will generated with create_universe.php.
$Timeout = 3600;                          // Cookie Timeout in seconds

$advlog_cookiecount = 80;								// How often should the security key be set
$advlog_ban_cookiecount = true;					// Ban if limit above is reached
$advlog_ban_wrongkey = true;						// Ban if a wrong key got found
$advlog_ban_wrongip = false;						// Ban if multiple player play's from the same IP


3b) Customice your config.php.
- Change the $gamename! (else all gamename's in the public list are the same. Do not start with Blacknova or Rednova! Do not add your URL! It is the NAME!!!)
- Set $maxlen_password = 32 (for MD5)
- Set $sched_type = ... (0 = real cronjob, 1 = player triggerd and JS-Cronjob, 2 = JS-Cronjob only)

4) Run create_universe.php (Is a must for RPP only you already have a previos version of RPP running!)

5) That's it, have fun!

 UPGRADE
---------
This is for Admin's who already have running BNT v0.41 _with_ a previos RPP patch.
*** NOT RECOMMENDED *** Use RPP with new games!

1) just replace all files in your BNT game directory with the new files from the new RPP patch.

2) Verify Step 3a and 3b of the installation.

3) That's it, have fun!

 JAVASCRIPT CRONJOB
--------------------
This is for games without a real *unix cronjob.

1) $sched_type must be 1 or 2. I set it to 1 so if the JS-Cronjob fail the player trigger it.

2a) Hold open the cronjob.php in any JavaScript and DOM able browser (e.g.: IE 5.x / Marzila 1.x)
    The JS reload the page every x minutes and start the scheduler.
    If there are some missed updates it will repeare the scheduler until all are done.

2b) Alternative, you kann call every x minutes the cronjob_light.php from any browser manually.

3) That's it, have fun!
